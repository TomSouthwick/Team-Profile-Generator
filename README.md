<h1 align="center">Team Profile Generator</h1>

  <p align="center">
    The Team Profile Generator is a efficicent way to generate a report that shows any given employees (Manager, Engineer and Intern) within a firm. This Command Line Interface prompt allows a user to input their working staff, whom of which are then outputted as their own card in a fully styled HTML and CSS webpage. Whilst the templates for the styling and landing page don't change - the content is dynamically generated into pure html which in turn is displayed as unique cards within the doucment each of which have a corresponding attribute and background image depending on the position that employee holds.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage
